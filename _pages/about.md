I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Seoul National University.
My research interests are in Cryptography and Privacy. Recently, I have been working on homomorphic encryption and multi-party computation. I am also interested in building cryptographic protocols to solve the privacy issues in machine learning.

Before joining Seoul National University, I was a senior researcher in Cryptography and Privacy Research Group at Microsoft Research Redmond, managed by [Kristin Lauter](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/klauter/), from 2019 to 2020.
Prior to that, I was a postdoctoral researcher at UC San Diego, under the supervision of [Sicun Gao](https://scungao.github.io).
I obtained my PhD in Mathematical Sciences at Seoul National University in 2018. My advisor was [Prof. Jung Hee Cheon](http://www.math.snu.ac.kr/~jhcheon/xe2/).
