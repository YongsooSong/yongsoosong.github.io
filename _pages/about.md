I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Seoul National University.
My research specializes in Privacy-Enhancing Cryptography (PEC) for secure computation. This includes fully homomorphic encryption, multi-party computation, and zero-knowledge proofs, approached from both theoretical and applied perspectives.

Before joining Seoul National University, I was a senior researcher in Cryptography and Privacy Research Group at Microsoft Research Redmond, managed by [Kristin Lauter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristin_Lauter), from 2019 to 2020.
Prior to that, I was a postdoctoral researcher at UC San Diego, under the supervision of [Sicun Gao](https://scungao.github.io).
I obtained my PhD in Mathematical Sciences at Seoul National University in 2018. My advisor was [Jung Hee Cheon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheon,_Jung_Hee).

I am always looking for motivated students with backgrounds in computer science and mathematics.
Our lab also has summer/winter internship programs to provide undergraduate students with research experience in the field of cryptography.
